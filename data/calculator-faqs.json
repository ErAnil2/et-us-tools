        "answer": "Simply subtract your current age from the current year. For example, if you are 25 years old in 2025, your birth year would be 2025 - 25 = 2000. However, if your birthday hasn't occurred yet this year, subtract one more year.",

        "answer": "This happens because age calculations depend on whether your birthday has passed in the current year. If your birthday is later in the year and hasn't occurred yet, you're technically still the previous age, which affects the birth year calculation.",
